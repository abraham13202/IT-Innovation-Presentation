            <div class="timing">⏱ 30 seconds</div>

            <h3>Opening (Speaker: Abraham or designated opener)</h3>
            <p><strong>What to say:</strong></p>
            <p>"Good morning/afternoon everyone. Thank you for taking the time to hear our pitch today. My name is [Name] and I'm the [Role] at FinSight AI. With me are my co-founders [introduce team briefly]."</p>

            <p>"Imagine being a small business owner trying to make critical financial decisions—whether to expand, how to manage cash flow, when to seek investment—but you can't afford the $50,000 per year it costs to hire a traditional financial advisor. That's the reality for 85% of small businesses today."</p>

            <p>"We're here to change that. FinSight AI is democratizing financial intelligence by bringing institutional-grade AI-powered advisory to every business, at a fraction of traditional costs."</p>

            <div class="speaker-note">
                <strong>Speaker Notes:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make eye contact with the audience (or investors)</li>
                    <li>Point to the three key statistics on screen as you mention the market opportunity</li>
                    <li>Speak with confidence but not arrogance</li>
                    <li>The $250B market stat immediately establishes this is a huge opportunity</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Key Message:</strong> Establish the problem (SMEs locked out of financial advisory) and preview our solution (AI-powered, affordable access).

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <div class="timing">⏱ 90 seconds</div>

            <h3>Opening (Speaker: Abraham or Product lead)</h3>
            <p><strong>What to say:</strong></p>
            <p>"Let's dive deeper into the problem we're solving. There are 32 million small and medium enterprises globally—businesses with 10 to 500 employees. These companies are the backbone of the economy, yet 85% of them lack access to sophisticated financial advisory services."</p>

            <h4>Current Barriers</h4>
            <p>"Why is this the case? There are four main barriers:"</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> "Traditional financial advisory firms charge upwards of $50,000 per year. For a small business with tight margins, this is simply not feasible."</li>
                <li><strong>Time:</strong> "Even if they try to do it themselves, manual financial analysis takes 20 to 40 hours every month—time that business owners don't have."</li>
                <li><strong>Quality:</strong> "The generic tools available—Excel spreadsheets, basic accounting software—provide no intelligent insights or personalized recommendations."</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> "And navigating compliance and regulatory requirements requires expensive expertise that most SMEs can't afford."</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Market Gap</h4>
            <p>"This has created a massive market gap. Big banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs focus exclusively on large enterprises and high-net-worth individuals. Robo-advisors like Betterment only handle basic investment portfolio allocation. There is no comprehensive AI solution addressing the full spectrum of SME financial intelligence needs."</p>

            <p>"This represents an $18 billion underserved market by 2028, and we're here to capture it."</p>

            <div class="speaker-note">
                <strong>Speaker Notes:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use hand gestures to emphasize the four barriers</li>
                    <li>Pause after stating "$50,000 per year" to let it sink in</li>
                    <li>When mentioning competitors (JPMorgan, Goldman), acknowledge they're successful but emphasize they don't serve this market</li>
                    <li>End with confidence on the $18B market stat</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Key Message:</strong> There's a huge, underserved market of SMEs that need financial advisory but can't afford or access current solutions. This is a real pain point with significant economic implications.

            <p>"So what's our solution? FinSight AI delivers institutional-grade financial advisory at 10% of the cost of traditional services. We're making sophisticated financial intelligence accessible to every business."</p>

            <ol>

            <h2>Technology: Generative AI</h2>
            <div class="timing">⏱ 90 seconds</div>

            <h3>Opening (Speaker: Technical lead - Vinayak)</h3>
            <p><strong>What to say:</strong></p>
            <p>"Let me explain the technology that powers FinSight. At our core, we use Generative AI—specifically, Large Language Models similar to ChatGPT, but trained and optimized for financial applications."</p>

            <h4>What is GenAI?</h4>
            <p>"Generative AI differs from traditional AI in a crucial way: instead of just classifying data or making simple predictions, GenAI can understand context, reason through complex scenarios, and generate human-like insights. The technology includes:"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Large Language Models that can process and understand financial documents, reports, and data"</li>
                <li>"Natural language understanding so business owners can simply ask questions in plain English"</li>
                <li>"Pattern recognition that identifies trends humans might miss"</li>
                <li>"Contextual reasoning that considers multiple factors simultaneously"</li>
                <li>"Content generation for reports, recommendations, and forecasts"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Our Innovation</h4>
            <p>"But here's what makes us different from just using ChatGPT or other generic AI:"</p>

            <p><strong>1. Finance-Specific Training:</strong> "We've fine-tuned our models on 10 years of financial statements from 50,000 companies, regulatory documents, market data, and industry benchmarks. This gives us 95% accuracy in financial document analysis, compared to 70% for generic LLMs."</p>

            <p><strong>2. Real-Time Data Integration:</strong> "We use a technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG. This connects our AI to live financial data—market feeds, economic indicators, your company's actual financial data. So you're not getting generic advice; you're getting current, context-aware recommendations."</p>

            <p><strong>3. Explainable AI:</strong> "Every recommendation our system makes comes with transparent reasoning. You can see exactly why the AI suggested a particular action, what data it considered, and its confidence level."</p>

            <p><strong>4. Compliance by Design:</strong> "We've built regulatory compliance directly into the AI architecture. The system won't make recommendations that violate financial regulations. This is critical for operating in a highly regulated industry."</p>

            <p>"The results speak for themselves: 95% accuracy, 100 times faster than human analysts, and available 24/7."</p>

            <div class="speaker-note">
                <strong>Speaker Notes:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If presenting to technical audience, you can go deeper; if non-technical investors, keep it high-level</li>
                    <li>Use analogies: "Think of it like having a financial analyst with 10 years of experience available in your pocket, 24/7"</li>
                    <li>Emphasize the competitive moat: specialized training data and compliance architecture are difficult to replicate</li>
                    <li>The 95% vs 70% accuracy stat is powerful—highlight it</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Key Message:</strong> Our technology is cutting-edge, purpose-built for finance, and provides real competitive advantages. We're not just wrapping a generic AI—we've built specialized, defensible technology.

            <h2>Innovation Model - Platform & Open Innovation</h2>
            <div class="timing">⏱ 90 seconds</div>

            <h3>Opening (Speaker: Strategy lead - Abraham or Aditya)</h3>
            <p><strong>What to say:</strong></p>
            <p>"Beyond our core technology, our business model itself is innovative. We're building FinSight as a platform, not just a product. Let me explain what this means and why it's strategically important."</p>

            <h4>Platform Innovation</h4>
            <p>"FinSight operates as a two-sided marketplace. On one side, we have SMEs and investors using our financial intelligence platform. On the other side, we have developers building specialized financial tools and applications."</p>

            <p>"This creates powerful network effects. The more users we have, the better our AI models become through more data. Better models attract more users. More users attract more developers who want to reach this customer base. More developers create more valuable applications, which makes the platform stickier for users."</p>

            <p>"This is exactly how successful platforms like Apple's App Store, Amazon Web Services, and Salesforce have built defensible moats. We're applying the same playbook to financial intelligence."</p>

            <h4>Open Innovation Strategy</h4>
            <p>"We're also embracing open innovation—the recognition that the best ideas come from everywhere, not just inside our company."</p>

            <p>"On the <strong>inbound</strong> side, we're actively sourcing external knowledge:"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"University research partnerships with MIT and Stanford keep us at the cutting edge of AI research"</li>
                <li>"We leverage open-source AI models as our foundation, then customize them"</li>
                <li>"Customer co-creation: we involve our pilot users in product development"</li>
                <li>"Data partnerships with Bloomberg and Refinitiv give us comprehensive market intelligence"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>"On the <strong>outbound</strong> side, we selectively share innovation:"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Our APIs are public, allowing developers to build on our platform"</li>
                <li>"We're releasing anonymized financial benchmarks as open data—helping the entire SME ecosystem"</li>
                <li>"We publish non-competitive research to establish thought leadership"</li>
                <li>"We're building a developer community with hackathons and free API tiers"</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Market Disruption - Dominant Design & Disruptive Innovation</h2>
            <div class="timing">⏱ 90 seconds</div>

            <h3>Opening (Speaker: Strategy lead - Abraham or Aditya)</h3>
            <p><strong>What to say:</strong></p>
            <p>"Now let's talk about market dynamics. We're pursuing a classic low-end disruptive innovation strategy, as defined by Clayton Christensen in The Innovator's Dilemma."</p>

            <h4>Low-End Disruption Explained</h4>
            <p>"Look at the table on screen. Traditional financial advisory firms target large enterprises and charge $50,000 or more per year. Their business model is labor-intensive—expensive human advisors providing white-glove service."</p>

            <p>"FinSight targets the market they ignore: SMEs that can't afford their services. We charge $199 per month—that's $2,400 per year, or less than 5% of traditional costs. Our business model is technology-enabled and scalable."</p>

            <p>"This is textbook low-end disruption. We're entering at the bottom of the market with a 'good enough' solution for customers who are over-served by expensive alternatives or not served at all."</p>

            <h4>Why Incumbents Won't Respond</h4>
            <p>"Here's why this strategy works: Traditional advisory firms <em>can't</em> respond effectively, even though they see us coming."</p>

            <p>"If they drop prices to compete with us, they'd cannibalize their high-margin services. Their CFO would say, 'Why would we give up $50,000 clients to chase $2,400 clients?' Their business model simply doesn't work at our price point."</p>

            <p>"They view the SME market as unprofitable with their cost structure. They're rationally choosing to focus on their existing customers. But that gives us a long runway to establish dominance in this massive underserved market."</p>

            <p>"And over time, as our AI improves through more data and feedback, we'll move upmarket. Eventually, we'll be competing for their high-end clients too—but by then, it'll be too late for them to catch up."</p>

            <h4>Dominant Design Emerging</h4>
            <p>"There's another dynamic at play: Generative AI, specifically transformer-based architectures, is emerging as the dominant design for financial intelligence applications."</p>

            <p>"Just like the PC architecture became the standard in computing, or how iOS and Android became the dominant mobile platforms, we're seeing industry convergence around GenAI. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America—they're all investing billions in similar GenAI architectures."</p>

            <p>"We're positioning ourselves to ride this wave. By establishing our platform early, we can become the standard for SME financial advisory as the industry matures around this technology."</p>

            <div class="speaker-note">
                <strong>Speaker Notes:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This slide addresses "disruptive innovation" and "dominant design" concepts from your rubric</li>
                    <li>Use the table to clearly show the contrast between traditional and our approach</li>
                    <li>The "why incumbents won't respond" argument is crucial—address potential investor concern about competition</li>
                    <li>Reference Clayton Christensen by name—shows you understand innovation theory</li>
                    <li>The upmarket movement point is important: we start at the low end but won't stay there</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Key Message:</strong> We're executing a proven disruption playbook. Incumbents are rationally ignoring us, giving us time to dominate the SME market before moving upmarket. GenAI is becoming the industry standard, and we're early.

            <h2>Business Model</h2>
            <div class="timing">⏱ 75 seconds</div>

            <h3>Opening (Speaker: CFO - Aditya)</h3>
            <p><strong>What to say:</strong></p>
            <p>"Let me walk you through our business model and unit economics. We've designed a model that's profitable at scale with strong margins."</p>

            <h4>Value Proposition & Customer Segments</h4>
            <p>"Our value proposition is simple: 90% cost reduction versus traditional advisory, with institutional-grade intelligence, 24/7 accessibility, and built-in compliance."</p>

            <p>"We target four customer segments:"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"<strong>Primary:</strong> SMEs with 10 to 500 employees—this is our core market"</li>
                <li>"Independent financial advisors who want to augment their services with AI"</li>
                <li>"Retail investors managing $50K to $1M portfolios"</li>
                <li>"Fintech platforms that want to embed our intelligence in their products—this is B2B"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Revenue Streams</h4>
            <p>"We have four revenue streams:"</p>
            <ol>
                <li>"<strong>SaaS subscriptions</strong> are our primary revenue source at 80%. Pricing starts at $199 per month for small businesses, scaling up to $999 per month for larger enterprises."</li>
                <li>"<strong>API usage fees</strong> at 10% of revenue. Developers pay per query to access our AI models."</li>
                <li>"<strong>Platform commission</strong> at 5%. When third-party developers sell apps on our marketplace, we take a 30% commission, similar to the App Store model."</li>
                <li>"<strong>Premium services</strong> at 5%. Custom model training, white-glove onboarding, consulting services."</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Unit Economics</h4>
            <p>"Our unit economics are strong and improving. We start at $199 per month, which is $2,400 in annual revenue per customer. By Year 3, we project:"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"75% gross margins—typical for SaaS businesses"</li>
                <li>"Customer Lifetime Value of $21,600"</li>
                <li>"Customer Acquisition Cost of just $600"</li>
                <li>"That's a 36-to-1 LTV to CAC ratio—anything above 3-to-1 is considered excellent"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>"The economics work because our marginal costs decrease with scale. AI inference costs drop as technology improves, while our models get better with more data. This creates a powerful flywheel."</p>

            <div class="speaker-note">
                <strong>Speaker Notes:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This addresses the "Business Model Canvas" requirement from your rubric</li>
                    <li>The LTV:CAC ratio is a key metric investors care about—emphasize 36:1 is exceptional</li>
                    <li>Gross margins of 75% show this is a high-quality SaaS business</li>
                    <li>Multiple revenue streams reduce risk; subscription is stable and predictable</li>
                    <li>If asked about the full Business Model Canvas, you can expand on key partners (cloud providers, data vendors), key activities (AI training, platform development), etc.</li>

            <h2>Traction & Go-to-Market</h2>
            <div class="timing">⏱ 75 seconds</div>

            <h3>Opening (Speaker: Product/Growth - Yash)</h3>
            <p><strong>What to say:</strong></p>
            <p>"We're not just a concept—we have real traction and a clear path to scale."</p>

            <h4>Early Traction</h4>
            <p>"We've already built a working MVP and have 25 pilot customers actively using the platform. The early metrics are strong:"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"4.5 out of 5 user satisfaction score"</li>
                <li>"85% monthly retention rate—users are staying with us"</li>
                <li>"35% referral rate—more than a third of our users have referred others"</li>
                <li>"Users report saving an average of $15,000 per year compared to traditional advisory"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>"This validates that we've found product-market fit. People don't just like it—they're willing to pay for it and recommend it to others."</p>

            <h4>Three-Year Milestones</h4>
            <p>"Here's our growth trajectory:"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"<strong>Year 1:</strong> We'll reach 250 customers generating $600,000 in annual recurring revenue"</li>
                <li>"<strong>Year 2:</strong> 1,500 customers, $3.6 million ARR"</li>
                <li>"<strong>Year 3:</strong> 5,000 customers, $12 million ARR, and we'll be profitable"</li>
                <li>"At that scale, we'll be ready for our Series A round—$20 million at an $80 million valuation"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Launch Strategy</h4>
            <p>"We're taking a phased approach to scale responsibly:"</p>

            <p>"<strong>Phase 1 - Beta Launch:</strong> Over the next 6 months, we'll expand from 25 to 100 beta customers. The focus is on refining product-market fit, gathering intensive user feedback, and building case studies we can use for marketing."</p>

            <p>"<strong>Phase 2 - Initial Launch:</strong> Months 7 through 18, we'll hit 1,000 paying customers. We'll invest in content marketing and SEO to drive organic growth, establish partnerships with accounting firms who can refer clients to us, and launch the API marketplace to attract developers."</p>

            <p>"<strong>Phase 3 - Scale:</strong> Months 19 through 36, we'll accelerate to 10,000 customers. This phase includes geographic expansion into Europe and Asia, signing enterprise partnerships with fintech platforms, and building out the platform ecosystem with 50-plus apps."</p>

            <div class="timing">⏱ 90 seconds</div>

            <h3>Opening (Speaker: CEO - Abraham)</h3>
            <p><strong>What to say:</strong></p>
            <p>"So let's talk about the investment opportunity. We're raising a $5 million seed round to accelerate our growth and capture this massive market opportunity."</p>

            <h4>Use of Funds</h4>
            <p>"Here's exactly how we'll deploy the capital:"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"<strong>40% - Product Development:</strong> $2 million to expand our engineering team by 10 people, enhance our AI infrastructure, and build out the features our customers are asking for"</li>
                <li>"<strong>30% - Sales & Marketing:</strong> $1.5 million for customer acquisition, content marketing to drive organic growth, and establishing strategic partnerships"</li>
                <li>"<strong>15% - Operations & Compliance:</strong> $750,000 for legal, obtaining necessary regulatory licenses like RIA registration, and building out our finance and operations team"</li>
                <li>"<strong>10% - Infrastructure:</strong> $500,000 for cloud computing costs, data feeds, and operational expenses"</li>
                <li>"<strong>5% - Reserve:</strong> $250,000 contingency for unexpected opportunities or challenges"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>"This gives us an 18-month runway to reach 1,000 paying customers and $2.4 million in annual recurring revenue—making us attractive for a Series A round."</p>

            <h4>Return Potential</h4>
            <p>"Let's talk about returns. We've modeled three scenarios:"</p>

            <p>"<strong>Conservative scenario:</strong> By Year 3, we reach $8 million in ARR with 3,000 customers. At a 5x revenue multiple—which is typical for profitable SaaS companies—that's a $40 million valuation. That's a 4x return on your investment."</p>

            <p>"<strong>Base case scenario:</strong> We hit our targets of $12 million ARR with 5,000 customers. At a 10x revenue multiple—standard for high-growth SaaS—that's a $120 million valuation. That's a 10x return."</p>

            <p>"<strong>Optimistic scenario:</strong> If we exceed projections and reach $20 million ARR with 8,000 customers, and we're still growing rapidly, we could command a $200 million valuation in an IPO or strategic acquisition. That's a 20x return."</p>

            <p>"Even in the conservative scenario, you're getting a 4x multiple in three years. But we believe the base case of 10x is achievable given our traction, the market opportunity, and our execution capabilities."</p>

            <h4>Key Investment Highlights</h4>
            <p>"To summarize why you should invest:"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"$18 billion addressable market with 32 million potential customers globally"</li>
                <li>"$12 million projected revenue by Year 3, profitable at scale"</li>
                <li>"Proven early traction: 25 pilots, 85% retention, strong NPS"</li>
                <li>"Defensible moat: proprietary training data, network effects, compliance expertise"</li>
                <li>"Experienced team with deep expertise in both AI and finance"</li>
                <li>"Clear exit opportunities: strategic acquisition by accounting software companies, fintech giants, or even big banks"</li>

            <h4>Investment Thesis Summary</h4>
            <p>"We're addressing a massive, underserved market: $250 billion in potential value, with 32 million SMEs globally who need but can't afford financial advisory services."</p>

            <p>"The timing is perfect. Generative AI reached production-ready maturity in 2023 and 2024. Market demand is surging as SMEs undergo digital transformation. Regulatory frameworks are becoming clearer. All the pieces are aligned right now."</p>

            <p>"We have a proven team—AI engineers from Google, financial experts from Goldman Sachs, experienced product leaders, and advisors who've successfully built and exited companies in this space."</p>

            <p>"We have early traction that validates product-market fit: 25 active pilots, 85% retention rate, 4.5 out of 5 satisfaction scores. Real customers are using and loving the product."</p>

            <p>"We're building a defensible business through network effects from our platform model, proprietary training data that gets better with scale, and deep compliance expertise that's hard to replicate."</p>

            <p>"And we're executing a proven disruption strategy. This is textbook low-end disruption—entering an underserved market segment that incumbents are rationally ignoring, then moving upmarket over time as our capabilities improve."</p>

            <h4>The Vision</h4>
            <p>"But beyond the numbers and strategy, here's what we're really building: we're democratizing financial intelligence. Right now, sophisticated financial advisory is a luxury good available only to the wealthy and large corporations."</p>

            <p>"We're making it accessible to every business owner, every entrepreneur, every person trying to build something. That small restaurant owner wondering if they can afford to open a second location. The freelancer trying to plan for retirement. The startup founder managing cash flow. These are the people we're empowering."</p>

            <p>"That's a mission worth pursuing, and it's a massive market opportunity worth capturing."</p>

            <h4>Call to Action</h4>
            <p>"We're raising $5 million to fuel our growth, reach 1,000 customers, and position ourselves for a strong Series A. We'd love to have you join us on this journey."</p>

            <p>"Thank you for your time today. We're happy to answer any questions you have."</p>

                <strong>Handling Q&A:</strong><br>
                Common questions to prepare for:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"What if big banks build this?"</strong> → "They could, but their business model conflicts. It would cannibalize their high-margin services. By the time they decide to respond, we'll have network effects and years of proprietary training data."</li>
                    <li><strong>"How do you handle regulatory risk?"</strong> → "We've built compliance into our architecture from day one. We have a former SEC commissioner on our advisory board and budget for proper licensing. Regulation actually helps us—it's a barrier to entry for competitors."</li>
                    <li><strong>"What's your customer acquisition strategy?"</strong> → "Three channels: 1) Content marketing and SEO for organic growth, 2) Partnerships with accounting firms who refer clients, 3) Platform ecosystem where developers bring their users."</li>
                    <li><strong>"Why can't someone use ChatGPT for this?"</strong> → "Generic AI has three problems: 1) Not trained on financial data so lower accuracy, 2) No real-time integration with financial systems, 3) No built-in compliance. We solve all three."</li>
                </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Practice the full presentation at least 5 times before the actual pitch</li>
                <li>Time yourselves—make sure you hit 10-12 minutes total</li>
                <li>Practice transitions between speakers smoothly</li>
                <li>Have backup plans if technology fails (can you present without slides?)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #fbbf24;">Delivery</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Make eye contact with the audience, not just the slides</li>
                <li>Speak clearly and at a measured pace—don't rush</li>
                <li>Use hand gestures naturally to emphasize points</li>
                <li>Show passion and enthusiasm, but maintain professionalism</li>
                <li>If you make a mistake, don't apologize profusely—just move on</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #fbbf24;">Engagement</h3>

                <li>Start with a hook: "Imagine being a small business owner..." (done in slide 1)</li>
                <li>Use rhetorical questions: "Why is this the case?" (done throughout)</li>
                <li>Tell micro-stories: examples of hypothetical customers helped by your product</li>
                <li>Use pauses for emphasis: after key statistics, let them sink in</li>
                <li>Vary your tone and energy—don't be monotone</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #fbbf24;">Team Coordination</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Decide who presents each slide ahead of time</li>
                <li>Practice handoffs: "Now I'll hand it over to [Name] who will discuss our technology"</li>
                <li>Support each other: nod along when teammates are speaking</li>
                <li>For Q&A, decide who's best positioned to answer different types of questions</li>
            </ul>

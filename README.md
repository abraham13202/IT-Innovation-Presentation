## üé® Key Visualizations Added

### Slide 2: The Problem
**Bar Chart - Cost Comparison**
- Visual comparison of advisory costs
- Shows FinSight AI is 95% cheaper

- Traditional advisory ($50K+) vs FinSight ($2.4K)

**Why it works:** Audiences process visual comparisons faster than reading numbers

---

### Slide 5: Platform Innovation
**Ecosystem Diagram**
- Three-box flow showing two-sided marketplace
- SMEs & Investors ‚Üê ‚Üí FinSight Platform ‚Üê ‚Üí Developers
- Arrows show bidirectional value flow
- Center box highlighted to show platform as hub

**Why it works:** Makes abstract "platform innovation" concept concrete and easy to understand

### Slide 6: Market Disruption
**Disruption Trajectory Curve**
- X-axis: Time
- Y-axis: Performance
- Traditional advisory: flat line (high but not improving)
- FinSight AI: steep upward curve (starting low, improving rapidly)
- Animated line growth for visual impact

**Why it works:** Classic Christensen disruption theory made visual. Shows you understand innovation theory and your strategy.

- Color-coded segments:
  - Blue (80%): SaaS Subscriptions
  - Green (10%): API Usage

## üé§ Presentation Tips

### Before You Start
1. **Practice with the visualizations** - know what's on each slide
2. **Point to specific parts** of charts while speaking
3. **Let visuals breathe** - pause to let audience absorb them
4. **Don't read the slide** - visuals are self-explanatory, you add context

### During Presentation

**Slide 2 (Bar Chart):**
- Point to the $50K bar: "Traditional advisory costs this much"
- Sweep to the $2.4K bar: "We're here - 95% cheaper"
- Emphasize the green color showing your solution

**Slide 5 (Ecosystem):**
- Point to left box: "We have users here"
- Point to right box: "Developers here"
- Point to center: "All connected through our platform"
- Use arrows to explain value flow

**Slide 6 (Disruption Curve):**
- Trace the traditional advisory flat line
- Then trace your steep curve
- "We start below them, but we're improving much faster"
- Reference Christensen by name

**Slide 7 (Revenue Pie):**
- "You can see 80% comes from subscriptions - stable, predictable"
- "But we have 3 other revenue streams reducing risk"
- Point to each segment as you mention it

**Slide 8 (Growth Chart):**
- Start at Year 1 point
- Move to Year 2: "6x growth"
- Move to Year 3: "3.3x growth, $12M ARR"
- "And this is when we're profitable"
